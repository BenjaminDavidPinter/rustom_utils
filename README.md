# What is this program?

I've been using a Mac for a little over two years now, and while I love almost everything about it,
one of the biggest pet peeves I have is just that; I don't know the intricacies of the system like I do Windows,
and Apple doesn't make it easy to find them.

Popular Unix peeking software works great on here, primarily Tree and HTOP. Problem is, there's a bunch of stuff
happening in the background that I just don't understand. That stuff leaves tons of files, cache entries,
and images on my system in order to give Mac that 'snappy feel'.

To hell with this; Even if I have to sacrifice a bit of that snap, I will create my own command line utils
for managing this computer.

# Inspectdir
Recurisvely dig through a folder, and report back # of files + total size of folder.
